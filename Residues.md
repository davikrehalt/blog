## Instances of Residue Theory (and Boundary maps in topology)

Let's start with the childhood version of residue theory, which is when we have a meromorphic function on the complex projective line. Then
the sum of the residues at points add to 0. This is witnessed by the following exact sequence.

$$0 \to \mathcal{O}^{\times} \to K^{\times} \to K^{\times}/\mathcal{O}^{\times} \to H^1(\mathcal{O}^{\times}) \to 0$$
