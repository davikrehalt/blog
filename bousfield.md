## Gluing Stable Categories

We would like to join stable categories. To proceed we will need a few definitions about categories. A category $\mathcal{C}$ is $\kappa$-filtered if every map from a $\kappa$ sized diagram/category to $\mathcal{C}$ can be extended to a map from its cone. An object is $\kappa$-compact if mapping from the object preserves $\kappa$-filtered colimits. On spaces, $\kappa$-filtered colimits commutes with $\kappa$ limits. We can check this on homotopy groups. A category is accessible if it is generated by $\kappa$-filtered colimits of $\kappa$-compact objects and the $kappa$-compact objects form a small category. $\kappa$-filtered colimits commutes with $\kappa$ limits in such categories. A category is presentable if it accessible and cocomplete (has all colimits). By standard arguments, a presentable category is equivalent to the $\kappa$-Ind category of its $\kappa$-compact objects. This allows the proof of the representable functor theorem (every limit preserving functor is representable by using the presheaf on the compact objects as an object in the actual category). This will then imply the adjoint functor theorem (existence of right adjoint for colimit preserving functor)(See section 5.5 in Higher Topos Theory). An accessible functor between presentable categories is one which preserve $\kappa$-filtered colimits and $\kappa$-compact objects). An accessible functor which is also limit preserving will admit a left adjoint.

The collection of presentable monoidal stable category and colimit preserving monoidal functors is enriched over stable categories. This allows gluing of stable categories which will allow us to gluing of rings, therefore allowing us to do scheme theory in this context.
