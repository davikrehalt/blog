HH homology is a E2 coalgebra over A as an E2 ring, if A is an E2 ring. Suppose A is E-infinity. Then we can consider HH as a A bimodule with both A's acting on one point in the circle. If we move one of the A actions in a circle, that is a sqrt(todd) class. Which is responsible for the twist when identifying the coalgebra structure. The natural HKR isomorphism is an isomorphism with both A's on one point.
