###Serre Duality in Context

Serre duality is classically the duality in coherent cohomology of smooth proper varieties/morphisms. It can be proven in many ways, for example by cleverly computing the right adjoint to pushforward locally with reduction formulae. However, the presence of Serre duality can also be seen at the level of smooth proper categories, which for me are presentable stable 2-dualizable categories over a ring $k$. In this setting the cobordism hypothesis says that there is a functor from Cob_2, the 2-category of up to 2 dimensional framed cobordisms to the 2-category $2-Mod(k)$. This takes the point (object of the Cob_2 category to the 2-dualizable category and it take the line (2d framed i.e. with a 2d bundle) to an endofunctor. Immediately we can see that the twisted line corresponds to some automorphism of the category. By examination, using the identification of the 1-dual of compactly generated categories, we can determine that it is indeed tensoring with powers of the canonical bundle, the same as the one from usual Serre Duality.

Now comes two observations. The loop induces a $k$-vector space, and there is one for each twist. For the $0$-twist, we get Hochschild homology with a $S^1$ action because $S^1$ fixes this $0$-twist. Otherwise, there is a $S^1$ worth of such circles given rise to $S^1$ worth of $k$-vector spaces. The most notable comes from the $1$-twist, which we can identify with Hochschild cohomology and its $E_2$ structure from the cobordism category. There is a $S^1$ worth of such $E_2$ algebras, agreeing with the general $S^1$ action on the class of $E_2$ algebras.

The Serre twist is therefore now identified with this $S^1$ action. Indeed we can also see this as follows. The framed two-manifolds--they represent two morphisms in $2-Mod(k)$. And therefore the circle action on 2-dualizable objects, they represent the notion of rotation between the two directions a two morphism can be multiplied, when the two morphisms is local (i.e on the identity 1-morphism). Hence, it is exactly the same $S^1$ action that acts on the class of $E_2$ rings.
