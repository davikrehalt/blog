## Stable Categories

For this post we will describe a simple yet extremely important property of the category of spectra, namely the fact that it is an example of a stable infinity category. First we will need some simple category theory. For any two categories $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{C'}$, the functor category is a category where the $0$-cells are functors as we discussed before. Between two functors, we have a space of natural transformations. There are some cardinality issues, which we will punt to our type theory having universes. (Additionally I would like to note at this point that we also assume some version of choice in our type theory) Suppressing details, we can define such a category where the input category is small ($\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{C'})$). (Note here that the collections of categories is a $2$-category. We can define $n$-categories as categories enriched over $n-1$-categories fairly easily using a similar definition to our definition of categories)
