## Deformation Theory I

Suppose $M$ is a manifold with a principal $G$-bundle, that is with a map 
$$M \to BG$$

To deform this map to first order is to produce a lift to T(BG) -> BG. This bundle is a vector bundle
with fibres $\mathfrak{g}[1]$. This amounts to a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued one form. Deformation to
general thickening require integrability conditions in the form of the Maurer-Cartan Equation. In general this is the 
DGLA view of deformation theory.
