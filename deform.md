## Deformation Theory Part I

# Square-Zero Extensions 

First for a presentable category $C$, for any object $A \in C$ we have an adjunction between $C_{/A}$ and $Sp(C_{/A})$. The left adjoint applied to an identity map is the cotangent complex of an object in $C$. This construction globalizes to all of $C$ to give a good theory. For $C$ being commutative rings, the stablization category is just the category of modules ($E_{\infty}$ modules are the same as left modules). If we were to do the calculation, it would correspond to computing the stabilized Hochschild homology (stabilized over colimit over $S^n$ of the E-infinity ring).

Let $R' \to R$ be a square-zero extension, this data is equivalent to the data of a groupoid scheme structure on Spec of $R \oplus M[1]$ (splitting via one of the maps from $R$ to $R \times_{R'} R$. By examination, we can see this is the same data as a derivation from $R$ to $M[1]$ or a map $L_{R} \to M$.

# Square-Zero Deformations

Suppose $M$ is a manifold with a principal $G$-bundle, that is with a map 
$$M \to BG$$

To deform this map to first order is to produce a lift to T(BG) -> BG. This bundle is a vector bundle
with fibres $\mathfrak{g}[1]$. This amounts to a $\mathfrak{g}$-valued one form. Deformation to
general thickening require integrability conditions in the form of the Maurer-Cartan Equation. In general this is the 
DGLA view of deformation theory.
