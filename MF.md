###Matrix Factorizations

The Clifford algebra is naturally thought of as an associative algebra over k[[t]] where t is a generator in degree $2$. Rationally there is no ambiguity for the underlying ring, but integrally we can take it over KU for example as well or higher Morava E-theory. They have some vector space $V$ generating in degree $1$/odd. Let's always invert $2$ for convenience. (odd commutator is sum bc sphere is flipped unrelated to previous sentence).

We should also consider matrix factorization categories. These are just module categories over $1$-d Clifford algebras. The trivial $1$-d Clifford algebra has a $E$-infinity monoidal structure, coming from co-algebra structure. It's a $D$-ring when tangent bundle is in odd degree. (idk how this can happen).

There's brauer classes here of the trivial MF category -> geometric object. The brauer classes are invertible elements of the ring. compare invertible elements of secondary K-theory and brauer classes. Knorrer peroidicity gives smoe equivalence of categories of MF category in certain context.

MF category is like a singularity category.
