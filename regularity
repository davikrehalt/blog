Regularity and smoothness are basic concepts in algebraic geometry, one of the first properties one asks about for varieties.

Smoothness is a relative concept related to $E_{\infty}$-cotangent complexes. 

For categories, one can use $E_1$ cotangent complex which gives rise to a noncommutative invariant.

Regularity is more complicated to make non-commutative.

This is because regular Noetherian rings of finite Krull dimension have two distinct properties which make it regular.

One is that it is finite gl. dim. Another is that it is regular coherent.

These are different for discrete commutative rings even. (oof) as there are inf diml regular rings and also there are non-coherent finite gl dim comm rings by Ofosky (A COMMUTATIVE LOCAL RING WITH FINITE GLOBAL DIMENSION AND ZERO DIVISORS--some construction with subsets of continuous functions)

Assuming smoothness gives finite gl dim but not regular coherent. Efimov gives the example of tensor square of free assoc algebra on 2 var, Ishan Levy gives the example of free assoc on generators in deg 1 and -1 (probably no t-structures on Perf of either of these rings) Though no K-theoretic obstructions for Ishan's alg and prob none for Efimovs (I didn't check)

K-regularity is vanishing of negative K-theory. It is not implied by smoothness (as all categories are filtered colimits of smooth ones and K-theory commutes with those colims) [also can use categorical compactifications in char 0] Also it is not implied by bounded t-structure by Neeman [which even gives singly generated examples by filtered colimits I think...)
                                                                                                        Anyhow I think there are few implications here..except if you assume smooth proper--then you could get some real milage, but idk how to show it...
