## Fourier Theory Part III: Generalizations

Luckily, now we are back to talking about nonsense instead of actually technical math. First let's talk about generalizing the Fourier Transform to a locally compact
Abelian group. To be honest, I'm not sure about classifications, but basically I think I see this category as just being built from 3 things. Circles, lines, and
cyclic groups. We've done lines, let's first now think about circles and cyclic groups as we attempt our generalization.

Yeah, so the point--the point is that somehow the dual of a LCH abelian group (or smooth or whatever structure I don't think it matters much) is the space of 
continuous group homomorphisms into a circle (don't ask me why), or basically it's like the space of simple representations (over $\mathbb{C}$)). So like suppose $G$
is our group and $G^{\vee}$ is our space of simple representations. This space has to by its nature have some universal properties. Like a line bundle over it
with a representation of $G$ on it. Or equivalently, there's a line bundle over $BG \times G^{\vee}$.
