## Classical Mechanics

Let us start this discussion by assuming the following set-up. Let $M$ be a manifold on which we have a particle. Such a particle has a velocity which in the tangent space of the manifold. Newton's first law tells us that it must travel along a straight line. This is not a well-defined notion when we only know our manifold up to diffeomorphism, and the reason is that there is no connection on our manifold. We may as well at this point assume some Riemannian structure on $M$. Then we have a notion of straight-line travel. Let us recall this.
