## D-modules

A $D$-module is simply a quasicoherent sheaf with the action of differential operators (it can be generalized
to a relative setting where we look only at differential operators which map to zero on the base).
It comes in two types, left and right $D$-modules. We can switch between
them with the right $D$-module of top differential forms (relative top forms in the relative case).
For now, let's focus on the absolute case, the relative case being an easy generalization.
For all $D$-modules, there is a notion of pushforward and a notion of pullback. These notions rely on the following
$(f^{-1}D_Y,D_X)$-bimodule for a given map $f:X \to Y$
$$D_{Y \leftarrow X}$$
which is left-right switched from the pullback of $D_Y$ to $X$.
