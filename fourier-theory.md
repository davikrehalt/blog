## Fourier Theory

Previously, the posts have presented a vision of homological algebra devoid of chain complexes and what-nots and replacing them fully with spectra,
the stablization of spaces. This approach is versatile and frankly better in all regards. But here we shift focus to some actual maths for a bit.

First off is Fourier theory, which deserves to be explained by someone who understands it better, but here you are. Let's start off with the classics.
The one and only, classical Fourier transform (up to some constants who nobody cares (but frankly maybe we should care?))

\[\mathcal{F}(f) := \int_{\mathbb{R}}{f(x)e^{2 \pi i t x}} dx}\]
