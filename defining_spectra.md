## Internal Model of Spectra

As promised, in our third post, we will give a much needed internal model of spectra. Before we do that, let us discuss what we know so far. We have defined an internal model of spaces and we have defined what a category is. We will state some facts and sketch very briefly why they are true. First, we have that there is a category of spaces. The $\mathr{Hom}$ spaces are the mapping spaces in simplicial sets extended to our setting. More precisely, the $0$-cells of the mapping space is simply the collection of maps from the left space to the right space, as in maps from $k$-cells to $k$-cells compatible with boundaries and with the appropriate identifications (coherent homotopies) of degeneracy maps. The $1$-cells will be homotopies and $2$-cells will be higher homotopies. It is left to the reader to verify this gives a category. With this category defined, there is almost no obstruction to generalizing almost all of ordinary category theory to this new setting. We define functors to be maps of objects and morphisms with composition and identity maps preserved up to coherent homotopies. There is a $\mathrm{Hom}$ functor to Spaces for any category. This will give a fully faithful (Hom space homotopy equivalent) functor embedding into presheaves. And so on and so on.

Instead of developing all of category theory now, I would like to instead begin talking about the main subject of this series--Spectra. Spectra is classically motivated by spaces stablized under suspension or as representing cohomology theories. For us, the importance of spectra is that by stabilizing spaces, we are miraculously left with a homotopy coherent gereralization of abelian groups. This will allow us to do ring theory up to homotopy coherence, which may otherwise have been very difficult if we start with the definition of a ring and tried to weaken it homotopically.
