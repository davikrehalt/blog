## Physics

Let me now take the time to ramble a bit about physics. First, let me give a new perspective on Fourier theory in one sentence. Fourier transforms are
simply a change of coordinates on the space of functions. The fourier transform changes coordines from characters of delta functions to characters of
derivatives (along vector fields which are group covariant). Also, the dual group is simply the group of characters. 

Now, let us move on to the real physics. Because the observables satisfy the factorization algebra theorems it is simply a En algebra at a point. Also 
the holographic principle is reflected in the boundary of visible->black hole->information density formula.
