## Zeta Functions Part III : Functional Equations and Tate's Thesis

Last time we saw that using Ã©tale K-theory, we have the equation

$$Z(s) = det((1-q^{-s}Fr)| H(X))$$

for the Zeta function. Now, we will endeavor to show the functional equation.

First, what is a functional equation? It is a statement of the form that 
$$Z(k-s) = (something) Z(s)$$
where the something is easy.

How could this happen?
